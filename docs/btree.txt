B Tree (b tree) (btree) notes

It is a self balancing tree which can handle massive data
It is better than AVL and Red Black trees
Tree of order 'm' or degree 'm' means it will have 'm' leaves
Each node will have more than one keys
There are three entities and have restrictions
1. Root : Has atleast two children
2. Intermediate nodes: Can have at least ceil[m/2] children and 'm - 1' keys
3. Leaves: All leaves have same level
Its time complexity is O(logN) with base 2
